# Mock-Stock
A mock stock website. It displays all of the Nasdaq stocks for the user (under the Trade Tab), by fetching the data from nasdaq's website. It also gets real time stock quotes from Yahoo Finance. It uses MySQL db in order to store users accounts and profiles. It uses AJAX calls through JQuery to dynamically display user's portfolio.
